About the Project 
  
This project focuses on harnessing machine learning techniques for the comprehensive 
prediction of multiple diseases. By leveraging a dataset comprising various health 
indicators, symptoms, and patient information, the goal is to design an efficient 
predictive model capable of identifying the probability of numerous diseases 
simultaneously. Employing a diverse array of machine learning algorithms such as 
decision trees, neural networks, and ensemble methods, the model will be trained to 
analyse complex health data and predict the likelihood of diseases such as diabetes, 
heart conditions, and others. 
 
The use of Machine Learning (ML) to predict multiple diseases at once is a significant 
development in the field of healthcare. Through the utilization of complex algorithms 
and the integration of various medical data sources, this methodology has the capacity 
to revolutionize the field of disease prevention and early diagnosis. By means of an 
extensive examination of genetic data, and relevant patient demographics, machine 
learning models demonstrate the ability to identify complex patterns and risk factors 
linked to a range of illnesses. 

Conclusion


The dataset consists of features such as serum creatinine, blood sugar fasting, 
glycosylated HbA1c, serum cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, 
triglyceride, VLDL cholesterol, sex, age, BMI, family history, diastolic BP, systolic BP, 
gestation (pregnancies), polycystic ovary, smoking, and exercise. We predicted various 
health conditions, specifically Diabetics, Vascular Issues, Heart Issues, Central Nervous 
Issues, Diabetic Retinopathy, Kidney Issues, and Nervous Issues, using the above 
features. 
• The "Random Forest" model achieved the highest accuracy of 88.32% for 
Vascular Issues. 
• GaussianNB performed with an accuracy of 78.48% for Heart Issues. 
• Logistic Regression achieved 79.36% accuracy for Central Nervous Issues. 
• The "KNN" model reached 88.10% accuracy for Diabetic Retinopathy. 
• For Kidney Issues, the "SVM" model achieved the highest accuracy of 89.52%. 
• The "ANN" model exhibited an impressive accuracy of 94.18% for Nervous 
Issues. 
• Logistic Regression achieved an accuracy of 75.8% for Diabetics.
